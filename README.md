# Node Shannon Entropy

[Shannon entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory) calculation to measure the information gain of an array of objects (i.e. average unpredictability in a random variable) in bits.

The algorithm is based on the equation

![equation](http://schuch.me/github/node-entropy/entropy_equation.png "Shannon Entropy Equation")

## Installation

```
$ npm install shannon-entropy
```

## Usage

```javascript
var entropy = require('shannon-entropy');
entropy.calculateEntropy(items, columns, function(entropy) {
	console.log(entropy);
});
```

```items``` is an array of objects on which the entropy algorythm is performed. The ```columns``` array includes all the keys of the object the entropy should be calculated of. The callback returns an object containing each key defined in the ```columns``` array and the value of the calculated entropy in bits.

### Example

```javascript
var entropy = require('shannon-entropy');
  
var items = [
	{
    	name: "Alex",
   		email: "hello@example.com",
   		year: 1980
    }, 
    {
    	name: "Peter",
      	email: "peter@example.com",
      	year: 1990
    }, {
      	name: "Bob",
      	email: "bob@example.com",
      	year: 2000
    }
];

var columns = ["name", "email", "year"];

entropy.calculateEntropy(items, columns, function(entropy) {
	console.log(entropy);
});
```

#### Output

The entropy of each property in bits.

```javascript
{ 
	name: 4.754887502163468, 
	email: 2.7548875021634687, 
	year: 0 
}
```

## Tests

```
$ npm test

{ name: 4.754887502163468, email: 2.7548875021634687, year: 0 }
All tests OK
```
